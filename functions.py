def greet_user(): #declaring/defining the function
    print('Hi There!')
    print('Welcome aboard')

print('Start')
greet_user()  #calling the function
print('Finish')
# what happens here is that , start is printed b4 hi there and welcome aborad because the two are only printed after the function has been called.
